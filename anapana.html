  <h1>Mini Anapana Meditation</h1>
  <p>
    This page shares a simple, non-sectarian meditation technique known as <strong>Anapana</strong> — the observation of the natural breath. 
    This is the first step in learning Vipassana and helps develop <em>samādhi</em> — concentration and mastery of the mind. 
    Even on its own, Anapana is a powerful tool for inner calm and awareness.

  <p>
    Below are two audio recordings from S.N. Goenka. The first includes an introduction and full guidance, and is recommended for initial use. 
    The second is a shorter practice session for regular use after you are familiar with the instructions.
  </p>

  <h2>Guidelines from S.N. Goenka</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sessions should take place in a quiet space suitable for meditation.</li>
    <li>Maintain complete silence and sit with a straight back throughout the session.</li>
    <li>Only Goenka’s recorded instructions should be used — no other guidance, live or recorded, should be added.</li>
    <li>No fee or charge should ever be taken for sharing this practice.</li>
  </ul>
